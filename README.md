## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

# AIM OF THE PROJECT:

to learn the concepts  of JavaScript ,DOM sectors, Event Listeners and implementation.

# WORK FLOW:

1. the elements cards are loaded into an array by the class object.
2. the class objects are added  and removed from the present class of the cards which helps in recognize the matched, unmatched or open cards.
3. the match condition of the cards is based on the cards type which was assigned to each card in the html document.
4. the moves of the player will increment after every 2 opens of the card.
5. the cards are loaded into the deck randomly ,hence the cards are not static all over the time.

 
# Game Instructions:

1. the user is provided with a deck of cards(16) in a 4*4 deck.
2. the player must match all the cards one by one;
3. the timer will start after the player choose a cards
4. if the player matched a pair of cards e],the cards will turn into green from blue and they are disabled by rewarding you a point  
5. if the player mismatched a pair of cards then the cards will turn  into red by they  hide again.
6. the selected card will turn into blue which means ready for match case.
7. when the player has 10,15,20  moves a star will be taken out , if the player was out of stars ,then the player is loss the game.
8. if the player has 8 matches then the player is  won the game.
9. after every notification the page will be reloaded means after player had loss the game or won the page will be refreshed.

# Installition

 1. clone the project code from the github.
 2. extract the code and run the project in your browser .
 3. the game is on the loaded in the browser  
 
# Conclusion:
hence the conceprs of the JavaScript, DOM sectors and Event listeners are implemented by developing the memory game.
